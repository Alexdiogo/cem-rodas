\subsection{Descrição detalhada}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Script to generate reports on translator classes from Doxygen sources.

  The main purpose of the script is to extract the information from sources
  related to internationalization (the translator classes). It uses the
  information to generate documentation (language.doc,
  translator_report.txt) from templates (language.tpl, maintainers.txt).

  Simply run the script without parameters to get the reports and
  documentation for all supported languages. If you want to generate the
  translator report only for some languages, pass their codes as arguments
  to the script. In that case, the language.doc will not be generated.
  Example:

    python translator.py en nl cz

  Originally, the script was written in Perl and was known as translator.pl.
  The last Perl version was dated 2002/05/21 (plus some later corrections)

                                         Petr Prikryl (prikryl at atlas dot cz)

  History:
  --------
  2002/05/21 - This was the last Perl version.
  2003/05/16 - List of language marks can be passed as arguments.
  2004/01/24 - Total reimplementation started: classes TrManager, and Transl.
  2004/02/05 - First version that produces translator report. No language.doc yet.
  2004/02/10 - First fully functional version that generates both the translator
               report and the documentation. It is a bit slower than the
               Perl version, but is much less tricky and much more flexible.
               It also solves some problems that were not solved by the Perl
               version. The translator report content should be more useful
               for developers.
  2004/02/11 - Some tuning-up to provide more useful information.
  2004/04/16 - Added new tokens to the tokenizer (to remove some warnings).
  2004/05/25 - Added from __future__ import generators not to force Python 2.3.
  2004/06/03 - Removed dependency on textwrap module.
  2004/07/07 - Fixed the bug in the fill() function.
  2004/07/21 - Better e-mail mangling for HTML part of language.doc.
             - Plural not used for reporting a single missing method.
             - Removal of not used translator adapters is suggested only
               when the report is not restricted to selected languages
               explicitly via script arguments.
  2004/07/26 - Better reporting of not-needed adapters.
  2004/10/04 - Reporting of not called translator methods added.
  2004/10/05 - Modified to check only doxygen/src sources for the previous report.
  2005/02/28 - Slight modification to generate "mailto.txt" auxiliary file.
  2005/08/15 - Doxygen's root directory determined primarily from DOXYGEN
               environment variable. When not found, then relatively to the script.
  2007/03/20 - The "translate me!" searched in comments and reported if found.
  2008/06/09 - Warning when the MAX_DOT_GRAPH_HEIGHT is still part of trLegendDocs().
  2009/05/09 - Changed HTML output to fit it with XHTML DTD
  2009/09/02 - Added percentage info to the report (implemented / to be implemented).
  2010/02/09 - Added checking/suggestion 'Reimplementation using UTF-8 suggested.
  2010/03/03 - Added [unreachable] prefix used in maintainers.txt.
  2010/05/28 - BOM skipped; minor code cleaning.
  2010/05/31 - e-mail mangled already in maintainers.txt
  2010/08/20 - maintainers.txt to UTF-8, related processin of unicode strings
             - [any mark] introduced instead of [unreachable] only
             - marks hihglighted in HTML
  2010/08/30 - Highlighting in what will be the table in langhowto.html modified.
  2010/09/27 - The underscore in \latexonly part of the generated language.doc
               was prefixed by backslash (was LaTeX related error).
  2013/02/19 - Better diagnostics when translator_xx.h is too crippled.
  2013/06/25 - TranslatorDecoder checks removed after removing the class.
  2013/09/04 - Coloured status in langhowto. *ALMOST up-to-date* category
               of translators introduced.\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyVerb}dedent(text : string) -> string

Remove any whitespace than can be uniformly removed from the left
of every line in `text`.

This can be used e.g. to make triple-quoted strings line up with
the left edge of screen/whatever, while still presenting it in the
source code in indented form.

For example:

    def test():
        # end first line with \ to avoid the empty line!
        s = '''\
        hello
          world
        '''
        print repr(s)          # prints '    hello\n      world\n    '
        print repr(dedent(s))  # prints 'hello\n  world\n'

\begin{DoxyVerb}Returns string formated to the wrapped paragraph multiline string.
